## Testing 

This app was built using the BDD approach. The components were built first followed by the tests. 

All tests can be found inside of the `./src/tests` directory.

Users can run the tests for themselves, by running `npm install` to install the dependencies, followed by `npm test` to run the tests.

## Styling
The styling of this app is still a work in progress
